# Philosophers 42 Project

A simulation of the **Dining Philosophers Problem**, built in C for the 42 curriculum.
It explores how multiple threads share resources safely without deadlocks or race conditions.

## How to Use

Clone the Git Repo and in the philo folder do $>make <br>
After that you should have a philo file that you excecute like this ./philo <number of philos> <time to live> <time to eat> <time to sleep> (<max meals>)

have fun :)
